# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator
Description:
The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a Java Swing-based desktop application that helps users estimate their daily carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions based on personal activities such as transportation, electricity usage, and diet. The tool calculates the total CO₂ output, provides actionable tips to reduce emissions, and visually represents the contribution of each activity through a dynamic chart. This project promotes awareness of environmental impact and encourages sustainable lifestyle choices.

Key features:
•	User Input for Daily Activities
o	Select transportation mode (Car, Bus, Bicycle, Walk) and enter distance traveled.
o	Enter electricity consumption (kWh/day).
o	Select diet type (Vegan, Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian).
•	CO₂ Emission Calculation
o	Calculates individual emissions from transport, electricity, and diet.
o	Computes total daily CO₂ emissions.
•	Dynamic Visualization
o	Displays a colored bar chart representing the percentage contribution of each activity to the total CO₂ emission.
•	Actionable Tips
o	Provides personalized suggestions for reducing carbon footprint, such as switching to public transport, conserving electricity, or adopting a plant-based diet.
•	Clear & Reset Functionality
o	Easily reset all input fields and results for new calculations.
•	Interactive GUI
o	Intuitive Swing interface with input forms, results panel, and chart visualization.

Technologies Used:
•	Java SE: Core programming language.
•	Java Swing: GUI development (JFrame, JPanel, JComboBox, JTextField, JButton, JLabel).
•	AWT Graphics: Drawing dynamic CO₂ contribution charts.

Learning Outcome:
•	Understanding of Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
•	Hands-on experience with Java Swing for GUI development.
•	Practical implementation of queues, loops, and dynamic visualization.
•	Ability to translate theoretical OS scheduling concepts into an interactive software tool.
